        <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
        <p >
        We invite submissions for our upcoming <b>Special Track on AI in Healthcare and Medicine</b> at <a href="https://adma2024.github.io/">The 20th International Conference Advanced Data Mining and Applications
        2024 (ADMA 2024)</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p >
        The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare has emerged as a beacon of innovation, promising transformative solutions to longstanding challenges in medical diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. 
        As we stand on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution, the integration of AI technologies holds immense potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, from precision medicine to personalized treatment strategies. 
        However, realizing this potential requires concerted efforts to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications in clinical settings.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p >
        In recognition of the pivotal role that AI plays in shaping the future of healthcare, the Special Track on AI in Healthcare and Medicine at the ADMA 2024 Conference seeks to provide a platform for researchers, 
        practitioners, and industry experts to showcase their latest advancements, share insights, and foster collaborations in this dynamic field. 
        We welcome contributions spanning a wide spectrum of topics, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI-driven diagnostic tools and medical imaging analysis</li>
            <li>Personalized treatment recommendations and precision medicine</li>
            <li>Predictive analytics for disease prognosis and patient outcomes</li>
            <li>Patient monitoring and healthcare management systems</li>
            <li>Ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks in AI-enabled healthcare</li>
            <li>Integration of AI with emerging technologies such as blockchain and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)</li>
            <li>Real-world applications and case studies demonstrating the impact of AI in healthcare delivery</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Formatting Guidelines</h2>
        <p >
        We welcome English-language papers containing original and unpublished contributions to the fields of data mining and related areas.
        Manuscripts should adhere to the LNAI (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) format. For the template and detailed instructions on LNCS style, please refer to 
        <a href="https://adma2024.github.io/call_for_papers.html">Springer's Author Instructions</a>.
        Papers should adhere to the main conference guidelines, ensuring they do not exceed 15 pages in LNAI format.
